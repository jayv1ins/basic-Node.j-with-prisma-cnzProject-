Basic-Node.js-with-Prisma-cnzProject: A Secure Node.js Web Application

This project focuses on building a basic Node.js website with heightened system security, designed for the subject of Cyber Security. It emphasizes safeguarding applications from common threats and attacks, ensuring data integrity and system robustness.

Key Features:
Input Protection:

User inputs are secured by preventing the use of special characters, reducing risks like SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
Validation layers sanitize all incoming data to block malicious payloads.
Custom Cryptography Algorithms:

A proprietary hashing system is developed for enhanced security.
Sensitive data, such as passwords, undergo secure and irreversible hashing, ensuring protection even in case of a data breach.
Prisma Integration with MongoDB:

MongoDB is used as the database for its schema-less feature, providing flexibility for storing and managing data.
Prisma ORM serves as a layer for secure and efficient interaction with the database.
Employs parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks and maintain data integrity.
Focus on Security Best Practices:

Implements rate limiting to mitigate brute-force attacks.
Uses HTTPS for secure communication.
Employs environment variable management to safeguard sensitive configurations like API keys.
Implements strong access controls for both users and administrators to restrict unauthorized data access.
User-Friendly Design with Robust Backend:

The website is designed to provide a smooth user experience without compromising backend security measures.
Logs and monitors all user actions to detect suspicious activities.
Advantages of Using MongoDB:
Schema Flexibility: Easily adapts to evolving data structures, making it ideal for rapid development.
Scalability: Supports horizontal scaling to handle high volumes of data and traffic.
Document-Oriented Storage: Data is stored in JSON-like documents, which are simple to manage and query.
Learning and Application:
This project demonstrates the practical implementation of cybersecurity principles in a real-world application. It highlights:

How to secure input forms from malicious attacks.
The importance of cryptography in protecting sensitive data.
Best practices for database security using MongoDB and Prisma.
By combining Node.js, MongoDB, and Prisma with a strong focus on security, this project showcases how to create web applications that are both functional and resilient to modern threats.
